Board Examples
==============

This examples are designed as simple standalone programs that run directly on the system. I create them to test the
functionality i will be providing via the HAL and this Board crate.

List of Examples
================

1. test_blink_serial

Initalises the clocks of the system and blinks two leds. Also initialises the uart0 to provide debugging
via serial out.
